This is an implementation for the IMDB movie review sentiment classification problem. Each movie review is a variable sequence of words and the sentiment of each movie review must be classified.

The Large Movie Review Dataset (often referred to as the IMDB dataset) contains 25,000 highly-polar movie reviews (good or bad) for training and the same amount again for testing. The problem is to determine whether a given movie review has a positive or negative sentiment. The data was collected by Stanford researchers and was used in a 2011 paper where a split of 50-50 of the data was used for training and test.
